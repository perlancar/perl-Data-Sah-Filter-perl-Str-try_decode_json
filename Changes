0.002   2022-07-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

        - Move test to examples since we are now using Test::Sah::Filter.


0.001   2020-02-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - First release. Currently unusable in Perinci::CmdLine-based
          applications because Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv will croak before we
          get to the prefilters.
