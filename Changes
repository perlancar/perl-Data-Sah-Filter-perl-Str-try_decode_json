0.003   2022-08-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

        - No functional changes.

        - [build] Rebuild with updated Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Data::Sah::Filter to
          render examples' summaries.


0.002   2022-07-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

        - Move test to examples since we are now using Test::Sah::Filter.


0.001   2020-02-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - First release. Currently unusable in Perinci::CmdLine-based
          applications because Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv will croak before we
          get to the prefilters.
